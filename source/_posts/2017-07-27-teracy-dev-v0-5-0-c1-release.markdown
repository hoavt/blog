We’re very happy to announce the release of teracy-dev v0.5.0-c1 that introduces lots of features and changes to support more development, deployment stack along with Docker and Kubernetes.



## v0.5.0-c1

As you known, the RC-1 version means “all minor bugs are fixed, the software works stably, and the code will be released unless there is a last minute bug found after test campaigns.”. However, to meet some requests from our client and community, we addes some features to this release.
<!-- more -->

## Changes

This major release includes some fixed bugs, document improvement and new features:

- Support the project base configuration. From now, you can add a list of vagrant configuration to your JSON file and extend the configuration from that.
- Update the document for the getting started with windows environment, nodejs debug.
- Add many tools to help your development process.
- Add the ability to extend and uniquely extend the array list of the configuration file.
- Introduce ACME101 as the sample project which shows the best practices of using teracy-dev.

There are more that you should explore yourselves when using ``teracy-dev`` for a while.

## What's next?

Hopefully, it will be useful for you and we're welcome any contribution, suggestion for ACME101. We're also adding more documents and guide for the project. 

We'll take all the feedbacks from v0.5.0 usage to continue making `teracy-dev` better and greater.
